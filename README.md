My graduation project at the Hanzehogeschool Groningen was done for STARK Learning to create a generic Virtual Reality tutorial for their VR trainings.

I worked together with 3D model creators to make an industrial environment that would be familiar to STARK's customers within the technical and industrial sector. The tutorial aims to introduce new users of VR to basic interactions such as teleporting and general buttons on a controller that they will need in the VR training that follows afterwards.

If you are interested in test results and further description of this project send me an email and I'll reply with my graduation document. This document describes the full research, design and development process that I went through to create my end product.
